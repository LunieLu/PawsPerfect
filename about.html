                <p>With extensive experience of caring for many different kinds of pets you can be assured I will care for your pet as you do.  I do not have a branded vehicle like many pet care providers as I believe it is extremely important for you, your home and your pets security not to advertise the fact you are not home.  
                <br>I have a DBS certificate, available to view on request. 
                <br>I have trained in Pet First Aid, Canine Behaviour, Canine Communication, Dog training. I am fully insured and registered with Professional Dog Walkers Association.

                I believe pet care is a vocation, some people 'decide' to be a dog walker or pet sitter as they think it is an easy way to make money and is lots of 'fun' spending time with animals, I have seen many of these come and go over the years, they begin to realise that it is incredibly hard work, you have to be committed, provide continuity for your clients and their pets, be extremely organised and have a passion for providing the very best service possible.  
                <br>
                It IS incredibly rewarding, but you have to be completely dedicated and never underestimate how much responsibility you have not only for the pets in your care but also for your clients home.
